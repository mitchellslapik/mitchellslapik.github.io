To investigate the internal clock of red knots, we caught red knots in the wild and brought them into the shorebird experimental facilities at <a href='https://www.nioz.nl/en/expertise/wadden-delta-research-centre/facilities-technology/labs-special-facilities/shorebird-experiment-facility'>NIOZ</a>). We then screened the behaviour of single individuals housed in indoor aviaries under constant dim light and constant temperature and hence shielded from environmental and social cues.
