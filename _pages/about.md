I strive to understand the World within and around me. 

As a **scientist**, I use birds, mainly shorebirds, to explore 
- <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41223-z'>rhythms of parental care</a> and <a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00093'>how such rhythms emerge</a>, 
-  <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20563'>within- and between-species differences in rhythmicities</a> and what may drive such differences, as well as
- <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13662'>distribution and evolution of traits across the globe</a>

**Currently**, I am investigating global similarities in shorebird parental care, global differences in uniparental incubation of shorebirds, biorhythms of red knots and drivers of global variation in the song of songbirds.  

I am an **associate professor** at   [Czech University of Life Sciences Prague](https://www.czu.cz/en) and **collaborate** with [scientists and institutions across the globe](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaw8529). 

I am a regular contributor to <a href='https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1583651'>iNaturalist</a>.
