Hello! I'm an MD/PhD student at <a href="https://med.uth.edu/">McGovern Medical School</a> interested in psychiatry and computational neuroscience. <br>
Originally from Austin, I studied philosophy at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>, and worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>. <br>
Then, I came to the <a href="https://gsbs.uth.edu/mdphd/">Medical Scientist Training Program</a> at UT, where I have been supported by the NIH through a <a href="https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F30">National Research Service Award</a> and a <a href="https://gsbs.uth.edu/ccts-t32/">Translational and Clinical Science Predoctoral Fellowship</a>. <br>
Ultimately, I hope to use computational neuroscience to better understand and treat psychiatric disorders. Find more information below:
